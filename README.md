# miniGames
This a collection of some (small) private projects in C++.


## Mindstorm
Lets you play mindstorm. A game where you have to correctly guess a number with three figures. The Computer gives you hints how many numbers in your last guess were correct and or at the correct place.

## MindstormSolver
Reverses the roles from Mindstorm. You think of a number, and the computer has to find it out while you give it some hints.

## Sudoku
Solves Sudokus automatically. The Sudoku has to be hard-coded, though.
